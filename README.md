### Stuff I do/did/doing:

_Things marked are completed and will receive updates whenever i feel like it or not at all; Things with a link next to it are published but not completed as I want or I'm not planning on stop giving updates. From top to bottom they are the closest to being finished._

- [x] [Minimalist Javascript library to add reactive states and nothing more](https://github.com/gabriele-vargiu/reactfulness).
- [x] [Python module for parsing .desktop files](https://github.com/gabriele-vargiu/parsed).
- [ ] Updating my blog.
- [ ] Richer and more formal markdown flavour for syntactically meaningful document transfer over messaging apps.
- [ ] Python QT vCard full spec editor.

_If you like some of my tools or applications please consider donating via [PayPal](paypal.me/vargiu), it'll be greatly appreciated and as of now my only source of income._
